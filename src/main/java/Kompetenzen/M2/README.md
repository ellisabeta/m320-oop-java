### Explanation to the sequence diagram:

There are three Roles in the sequence diagram the user, the flight class and the passengers class.

I have three methods addPassenger, printPassengerList and removePassenger and there is a while loop
in the diagram which iterates over the three methods.

The flow goes as following:  
- The user adds a passenger and the passenger list is being printed out.
- Then there is a system out print line which asks to remove or add passenger
- Corresponding to whichever option the user chooses, the following
method in if else will be done.
  
At the end of the loop the list of passengers is being printed out.
